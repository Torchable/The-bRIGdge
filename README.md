# The-bRIGdge
The bRIGdge is an Autodesk Maya UI primarily for creating controls for rigging. It is always updated to add new controls and features as I learn more about Python in Maya!

How to install (For Windows):

1. Download the 'shelf_brigdge.mel' file and the 'thebRIGdge.py' file

2. Place the 'shelf_brigdge.mel' file into your shelves folder under C:\Users\[user]\Documents\maya\[version]\prefs\shelves

3. Place the 'thebRIGdge.py' file into your scripts folder under C:\Users\[user]\Documents\maya\[version]\scripts

4. Restart Maya and you should have the bRIGdge shelf in the shelves section of your HUD.
